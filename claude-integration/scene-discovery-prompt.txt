You are an expert short-clip editor for talking-head videos.
Read the SRT transcript and identify coherent content blocks that feel complete.

SRT file:
__SRT_PATH__

Goal: find candidate clips that contain a complete thought arc and can stand alone.
Clip length should be between 30 and 300 seconds.

Completeness criteria (use as a checklist):
- Question -> answer/explanation
- Problem -> cause -> solution
- Claim/thesis -> reasoning -> conclusion
- Example/anecdote -> point/lesson
- Contrast/objection -> rebuttal -> takeaway
- Step-by-step explanation with a clear end state
- Story with setup, turning point, and resolution
- Definition -> elaboration -> implication
- Cause -> effect -> implication
- Myth -> correction -> lesson

Avoid:
- Endings that feel cut off or mid-thought
- Segments that require context from earlier/later to understand
- Filler or meta-commentary without a clear point

Restart/retake handling (important):
- If the speaker says they will restart or redo (e.g. "ich fange nochmal neu an",
  "ich mach das nochmal", "ich starte nochmal", "neuer Versuch", "lass mich nochmal anfangen"),
  treat the material before that point as discarded.
- Do not create candidates that overlap such restart markers.
- Start candidate selection only after a clear new start following the restart marker.

Return strict JSON only (no extra text):
[
  {
    "candidate_id": "string",
    "start_time": 0.0,
    "end_time": 0.0,
    "reason": "short rationale for why this is a complete thought"
  }
]
